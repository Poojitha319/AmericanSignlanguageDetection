# American Sign Language Prediction
# Overview
This American Sign Language Prediction System is developed as a small web application using streamlit module.It is more useful for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.ASL prediction technology can serve as a bridge for communication with those who do not understand sign language.It can be integrated into mobile apps or wearable technology to provide real-time translation of ASL into spoken or written language.And it widely used in health care sectors.This technology can be implemented in hospitals for analysing patient moments based on his/her gestures/signs.
